# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Workshop Onboarding section. This included installing Chrome and VSCode, along with the "Open in Default Browser" extension. Took the Pre-Assessment Quiz and completed it with a score of 72%.

**Thoughts:** I've recently started coding. After exploring many different resources and ways of learning, I've decided to work through The HTML and CSS Workshop from Packt. I was pleasantly surprised to get such a high score in the quiz, as I'm relatively new to modern HTML and CSS. However, it did highlight some areas I need to focus on â€“ JavaScript, SASS, RWD and working with audio & video.

### Day 1: December 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started reading Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS. Finished the Overview and Introduction. Read about two-thirds of the HTML section. Used VSCode to experiment with all the code snippets. Uploaded these snippets to GitHub.

**Thoughts:** This was a really interesting introduction to HTML. I love the new content type categories in HTML5. So much clearer and useful than the block-level/inline distinction in previous versions of HTML.

### Day 2: December 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued reading Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS. Finished the HTML section and read Structuring an HTML Document. Completed the first two exercises and watched the exercise screencasts. Carried on using VSCode to experiment with all the code snippets. Uploaded those snippets again to GitHub, along with the two exercises. Set up a website using GitHub Pages. Created a branch of my main code repository so I could publish my completed exercises. Learnt how to create a pull request and successfully merged my changes.

**Thoughts:** A very productive day! Learnt a lot about the different metadata you can include in the head of an HTML document. Was good to work through my first exercises instead of just playing with small code snippets. One code snippet was a small piece of JavaScript which I then successfully embedded inside an HTML document without any difficulty. Yay! And after a bit of trial-and-error I got my GitHub Pages site up and running. Took a little longer to work out how to publish the exercises from a different repository but got there in the end. Awesome feeling when everything was finally published and out there on the web! Double that feeling when everything looked great on my phone too!

### Day 3: December 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Read more from Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS. Read the sections on "Mistakes in HTML" and "Validating HTML". Completed two more exercises and watched the screencasts for them. Continued to play around with code snippets in VSCode. Finished my first activity from the book. All new code uploaded to GitHub. GitHub Pages site updated.

**Thoughts:** Steady, if not spectacular, progress today. Spending more time each day looking at the HTML Living Standard. And if the standard isn't clear or doesn't answer my question, I've been using the MDN, W3Schools and StackOverflow for clarification. For example, learning to put my meta charset before the title element. The first activity was very straightforward and I correctly completed it without having to refer to the given solution. The later activities will be a good test to see if everything else is sinking in as much. Looking forward to starting the CSS section tomorrow!
