# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Workshop Onboarding section. This included installing Chrome and VSCode, along with the "Open in Default Browser" extension. Took the Pre-Assessment Quiz and completed it with a score of 72%.

**Thoughts:** I've recently started coding. After exploring many different resources and ways of learning, I've decided to work through The HTML and CSS Workshop from Packt. I was pleasantly surprised to get such a high score in the quiz, as I'm relatively new to modern HTML and CSS. However, it did highlight some areas I need to focus on â€“ JavaScript, SASS, RWD and working with audio & video.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
