# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Workshop Onboarding section. This included installing Chrome and VSCode, along with the "Open in Default Browser" extension. Took the Pre-Assessment Quiz and completed it with a score of 72%.

**Thoughts:** I've recently started coding. After exploring many different resources and ways of learning, I've decided to work through The HTML and CSS Workshop from Packt. I was pleasantly surprised to get such a high score in the quiz, as I'm relatively new to modern HTML and CSS. However, it did highlight some areas I need to focus on â€“ JavaScript, SASS, RWD and working with audio & video.

### Day 1: December 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started reading Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML and CSS. Finished the Overview and Introduction. Read about two-thirds of the HTML section. Used VSCode to experiment with all the code snippets. Uploaded these snippets to GitHub.

**Thoughts:** This was a really interesting introduction to HTML. I love the new content type categories in HTML5. So much clearer and useful than the block-level/inline distinction in previous versions of HTML.
